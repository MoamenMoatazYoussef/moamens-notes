## Table of Contents

## Prerequisites
- Java Fundamentals course.
- Java Core course.
- Basic knowledge about data structures is a plus, specifically:
    + Lists and Linked Lists.
    + Stacks and Queues.
    + Trees, especially binary trees.
    + Hash tables.
    You only need to know what they are and their basic functions, you **don't need** to have implemented trees or hash tables by yourself.
- Basic knowledge about Big-O notation for performance is a plus.

## Tips
- *sysout* means System.out.println, I'm lazy.
- FIFO means First-in first-out

## Just Use Arrays
**Why don't we just use Arrays to solve our daily Collection or Data Structure problems?**
Look at this code:
``` java
class Product {
    private String name;
    private int weight;

    public Product(String name, int weight) {
        this.name = name;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
}

public class Main {   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product door = new Product("Door", 35);
        Product floorPanel = new Product("Panel", 25);

        Product[] products = { door, floorPanel };

        System.out.println(products);
    }
}
```

You know what the output will be?
It will be like this:
```
[Lcom.monotonic.collections.Product;@18ff79
```
Or something like that. That's weird, and we can't understand anything from it.

We would get a better output by using Arrays.toString():
``` Java
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(products));
```

**What about adding elements to arrays?** <br/>
Look at this code:
``` Java
Product window = new Product("Window", 10);
products[2] = window;

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(products));
```
We'll get an *Exception*, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException specifically.
That's because Arrays don't resize automatically to include new elements, we need to do that manually, like this:
``` Java
Product window = new Product("Window", 10);
Product[] newProducts = Arrays.copyOf(products, products.length + 1);
newProducts[products.length] = window;
products = newProducts;

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(products));
```
The reality, however, is that we've copied the array in a new array that has a length that's bigger by 1, then added the new element.
That means, we'll need to copy arrays every time we add or remove elements.

- What if we don't want duplicates in an Array? we'll need to check that every time we add something to an array.
- What about any constraint we want to apply on arrays? We need to manually implement them and check them in any operation done on arrays.

These reasons make developers carry the weight of implementing their own data structures. There are obviously very common data structures, especially the ones studied in theory. So why not just *make a framework of these data structures* so that they are common and easy to use, and also still make Java portable.

***Note:*** Yes, it might be fun to implement them yourself, you can do that in your own Java projects, but in real-life projects that must conform to deadlines and quality standards, it's better to use the already used and tested Java Collections, to save you time of implementation, testing, debugging, deploying, and a lot more steps in the software development process. (Re-inventing the wheel)

This, plus the cases we explored above, plus many other reasons, are why it's much better to use Java's data structures, called Collections. They are a framework of data structures that ship with the JDK, and they are ***EVERYWHERE*** in any java product.

## The Java Collections Framework
### Collection Interface
The Collection framework consists of two things:
- A set of Interfaces that define the behavior of each data structure.
- A set of Implementations for these interfaces.

Usually the interfaces are used to indicate variable types, so we will explore both Interfaces and Implementations.

An very common example is this:
``` Java
List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```
- We defined a variable myList.
- Whose type is *List*
    + *List* is an interface, not an implementation, so we need to use an implementation of List in order to be able to use myList.
- Then we used a popular implementation of *List*, which is *ArrayList*, to assign myList to an implementation.
- Now, we can use myList :smile"
- At the same time, remember that a reference variable of datatype MyClass can point to any MyClass object, or any other class that inherits from MyClass.
- This means that the myList is still a reference to a *List*, not an *ArrayList*.
- So, if there is another implementation (for example, *MyAwesomeList* implements *List*) that you want to use, that implements *List*, you can easily switch it :smile: (This is called the *Programming to Interfaces* design principle).

Any collection interface in Java extends a main interface, the *java.util.Collection* interface.

Popular interfaces that implement *Collection*:
- *List:* the most commonly used collection, they are:
    + Ordered.
    + Indexed.
- *Set* and *SortedSet:* these collections have:
    + Distinct elements.
    + SortedSets are Ordered.
    + The interface SortedSet extends the interface Set.
- *Queue* and *Deque:* they are:
    + *Deque* stands for Double-Ended Queue.
    + Ordered by the order of inserting into them.
        - *Queue* is a FIFO-ordered.
        - *Deque* is a FIFO and LIFO-ordered. (A good use case for *Deque* is implementing a Stack).
- *Map* and *SortedMap:* they are 
    + key/value pairs.
    + SortedMap is Ordered, we can iterate on them.

Implementations for these interfaces:
- List: implemented by *ArrayList* and *LinkedList*.
- Set: *HashSet*.
- SortedSet: *TreeSet*. (It also implements *Set* because *SortedSet* extends *Set*).
- Queue: *PriorityQueue*.
- Deque: *LinkedList* and *ArrayDeque*.
- Map: *HashMap*.
- SortedMap: *TreeMap*.

### How do we pick a data structure to use
Here's a simple flow chart to use.
- Are elements keyed (i.e. are they in key/value pairs) ?
    + Yes: Is order important?
        - Yes: **SortedMap.**
        - No: **Map.**
    + No: Are elements unique?
        - Yes: Is order important?
            + Yes: **SortedSet.**
            + No: **Set.**
        - No: FIFO?
            + Yes: **Queue or Deque.**
            + No: LIFO?
                - Yes: **Deque.**
                - No: **List.**

### Behaviors of Collections
So what are the common behaviors and methods that collections have?
Some of these are:
- Iteration: being able to go over all the elements of a collection.
- Sizing: changing a collection's size.
- Mutation: changing some elements or changing some features of the collection itself, like adding/removing elements.

**Some Behaviors of the *Collection* interface** <br/>
- size(): returns how many elements inside the Collection.
- add(..): adds an element to the Collection.
- remove(..): removes an element from the Collection.
- contains(..): checks if an element is present inside a Collection, returns true if the element is indeed inside the Collection, false otherwise.
 - isEmpty(): checks that the Collection has no elements, returns true if it has no elements, false otherwise.

Check all the behaviors specified by *Collection* here:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html

**Iteration** <br/>
There is an interface called *Iterable*, it defines something tha we can iterate over i.e. we can:
- Get an iterator, sort of a pointer or a cursor that can go over all the elements in a collection.
- Use that iterator to go over the elements.

Let's print the elements of a Collection, remember this code:
``` Java
class Product {
    private String name;
    private int weight;

    public Product(String name, int weight) {
        this.name = name;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
}

public class Main {   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product door = new Product("Door", 35);
        Product floorPanel = new Product("Panel", 25);

        Product[] products = { door, floorPanel };

        System.out.println(products);
    }
}
```

We'll change it a bit:
- First, we'll use a Collection variable.
- We'll implement it using ArrayList.
- We'll print the elements if the Collection each in its line.
- We'll use an iterator to do the printing.
Look at this code, read the comments.
``` Java
public class Main {   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product door = new Product("Door", 35);
        Product floorPanel = new Product("Panel", 25);

        // Here, we instantiate a Collection variable
        // And implement it using the concrete implementation ArrayList.
        // Note: it's a generic type, so we give it a type <Product>
        Collection<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();

        // Here, we use Collection's method to add elements to the Collection "products"
        products.add(door);
        products.add(floorPanel);

        // Now to the iterating part.
        // First, we need to make an iterator variable, Iterator is a datatype in Java
        // it's a generic datatype, so we should give it a type to iterate over, which is <Product>
        // Then, we want this iterator to be an iterator of the Collection "products"
        // So, we use Collection's method iterator() to retrieve an iterator of "products"
        // and store it in the variable we just made, so that we can be able to use that iterator.
        final Iterator<Product> productIterator = products.iterator();

        // The Iterator now doesn't point to an element in the collection, but it will point to
        // the first element when we actually use it.

        // Now, to actually use the iterator to loop over the things inside the list
        // we use a loop, but instead of using an index, we use Iterator's method hasNext()
        // a method that returns true of there are elements that we haven't gone over with the Iterator yet
        while(productIterator.hasNext()) {

            // Then, to get the element pointed out by the iterator, we use the next() method
            Product product = productIterator.next();
            System.out.println(product);
        }
    }
}
```

But that's a lot to do, isn't it? <br/>
Don't worry, all that work is bundled in a new loop, a forEach loop, look at this code:
``` Java
public class Main {   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product door = new Product("Door", 35);
        Product floorPanel = new Product("Panel", 25);

        Collection<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();

        products.add(door);
        products.add(floorPanel);

        // Wow, that's a lot easier
        for(Product product: products) {
            System.out.println(product);
        }
    }
}
```

You may have a question, **So why bother using Iterators at all then?** <br/>
The forEach loop is pretty good, but there are *some* things you can do with iterators that you can't do with forEach loop, for example, let's change our use case to this:
- If the product's weight is above 20, print it.
- Else, remove it from the list.
We can do this using an iterator like this:
``` Java
public class Main {   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product door = new Product("Door", 35);
        Product floorPanel = new Product("Panel", 25);

        Collection<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();

        products.add(door);
        products.add(floorPanel);

        final Iterator<Product> productIterator = products.iterator();

        while(productIterator.hasNext()) {

            Product product = productIterator.next();
            if(product.getWeight() > 20) {
                System.out.println(product);
            } else {

                // The iterator method remove() removes the element pointed to by the iterator from the list
                // but don't worry, the iterator still points to the list, and when we use .next() it'll go
                // to the next element, the refernece isn't lost :smile:
                productIterator.remove();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the next chapter, we'll examine the main behaviors of each Collection:
- How it works.
- How we can use it.

## Lists
So, what is a list? <br/>
Lists are collections with iteration order, there is an order of iteration that's clearly defined by an index.
We use the index to navigate Lists.
All the APIs of Lists should rely on the index to do any operations.

What are some methods in List that use index?
Let's say we have a List of elements of datatype "E", like:
``` Java
class E { // code }
List<E> myList = new ArrayList<E>();
```
These are some of the methods we can use:
- add(int index, E e): adds the element e at the index *index*.
- remove(int index): removes whatever element at *index*.
- set(int index, E element): updates the elemet at index *index* to be the element *e*.
- addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> c): adds all elements in the Collection *c* at *index*.
- indexOf(Object o): returns the index of the first element that matches the object *o*.
- lastIndexOf(Object o): returns the index of the last element that matches the object *o*.
- subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex): returns a list of elements starting from the index *fromIndex* to the index *toIndex*. 
    
***Note:*** *fromIndex* is inclusive, *toIndex* is exclusive, so if we do this:
``` Java
List<E> newList = myList.subList(1, 3);
```
newList will contain the elements from myList between indices 1 and 3, it will include:
- myList[1]: this is included because the argument *fromIndex* is inclusive i.e. the element whose index is *fromIndex* is included in the subList.
- myList[2]
That's it, no more elements.

Notice that myList[3] is **Not** included in the sublist, that's because the argument *toIndex* is exclusive i.e. the element whose index is *toList* is **Not** included in the subList.

### ArrayList
This is an array that's backed by a List.
Remember that when we want to add an element to an array we had to copy and do a lot of stuff?
Instead of that, the ArrayList doubles the size of the array when we add things to the array, for example:
- If we have an ArrayList of size 1, and we add an element.
- The size becomes 2, when we add another element.
- The size is doubled to 4.
- Now we can add 2 elements with no resizing, until we fill the 4 spaces.
- Then we add another element, the size jumps to 8.
- Now we can add 3 more elements with no resizing, until we fill the 8 spaces.
- Then we add an element, the size jumps to 16.
- Now we can add 7 more elements with no resizing.
And so on.

As you can see, the resizing is much less frequent in ArrayLists than in plain old arrays.

ArrayLists are good general purpose implementations:
- If you don't know the characteristis of your lists are, just use ArrayList as a default choice.
- They are optimized and efficient.
- Modern CPUs have difficulty because they are so much faster than memory in modern hardware, to compensate for this, they have cache memories to act as intermediate between them and the main memory (the RAM), because ArrayLists are still arrays, the spaces are right next to each other in the memory, so the positions of elements are predict

**Use cases** <br/>
- If you will access and modify existing elements a lot, use ArrayList. 
- If you won't insert or remove elements that much, use ArrayList.

### LinkedList
This is a doubly linked list, with references for the Head and the Tail of the list.
This is really good if we will add and remove elements in the list a lot, because we don't copy anything, we just adjust the references of the elements before and after the new element.

It's slower than ArrayLists because it has to do this reference chasing all the time.

LinkedLists are Lower in performance than ArrayLists in most operations, but they have their use cases.

**Use cases** <br/>
- If we're adding elements at the start very frequently, use LinkedList.
- If you're adding or removing elements very frequently, use LinkedList.

### Performance Comparison between ArrayLists and LinkedLists

![ArrayList VS LinkedList Performance Comparison](https://miro.medium.com/max/904/1*XSFsLZYm0B8UcjztjEbzzA.png "ArrayList VS LinkedList")

Check the full list of behaviors by *List* here:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html

## Sets
Sets are collections of *distinct* elements.

Unlike the List interface, the Set interface don't really have additional methods, it just has the methods that are in the Collection interface. So there is no additional functionality, except that **the elements are unique in the Set.**

There are three popular implementations of Set:
- HashSet.
- TreeSet. (Also implements SortedSet)
- EnumSet: This is a set specifically designed to be efficient when dealing with enum types.

### HashSet
This is based on the HashMap, which implements Map, or basically a map data structure.
It's like a set and a hash table data structure combined.

Hash tables and *HashMaps* use a hash code to look up objects inside them, so, to use a HashSet we need to use a method to create a hash code, and there is a method hashCode() that's in *java.lang.Object* i.e. everything in Java inherits that method.

**How do HashSets work as sets?** <br/>
They are basically HashMaps, but instead of having Key/value pairs, we have Key/Value pairs but the value is basically value that indicates that a certain key is present.

So our values in a set are actually the internal HashMap's *keys*, and when we insert something in the set, it's kept unique by using the value we pass as a key and seeing if it's present in the HashMap and has a value.

***Note from Moamen:*** If you have trouble understanding hash tables, hash codes, and all that stuff, there will be a course on Data Structures that will cover Hash tables in theoretical detail :smile:

HashSets are:
- Good general purpose implementations. 
- They resize when it's full and we add data.
- Perform well, as you can see, checking that a value exists is basically checking that a key exists in a HashMap, it's an O(1) procedure, we don't iterate like Lists.

**The HashCode contract** <br/>
Remember that the feature of sets are that no two elements are the same in a Set, but what does "*the same*" mean?

There is a method in Java, called equals(..), this method is used to compare elements for equality, and we can actually override it.

So, if we have custom objects or classes, and we want to check if two objects of that class are equal, we can orverride the equals() method to enforce our own equality rules, but this is not recommended.

The implementation of the equals() method is also called the *contract*, for example, in *List*, the contract is that a *List* can only be equal to another *List*, it can't be equal to a *Set* or a *Map*. This means that the .equals() method won't work if the caller is a *List* and the argument is not a *List*.

In HashSets, elements should be unique because after all, it's a *Set*. <br/>
To do this, the HashSet has a contract for the objects inside it, the .equals() method.
The contract is that: ***"Both objects must have the same hash code"***. <br/>

So, even if there are two equal objects, if they have different hash codes, the HashSet will accept both of them, it will *see* them as distinct.

So, we need to be very careful when doing that. We implement the hashCode method, so we need to make the hashCode method's algorithm similar to the equals() method's algorithm.

For example, if we want to make two objects equal if they have the same values for the internal fields, we can implement the equals() method of that.

But, we would want the hashCode() method to be similar, for example:
- Begin with a variable *result*, initialize *result* with any non-zero number.
- Then, for every field:
    + Call the original hashCode() on the field.
    + Add it to the (*result* x 31). (Or any non-prime integer, so that we avoid *hash code collisions*, we'll explain that later).

**This is a list of correct hashcodes for different data types** <br/>
![Hashcodes](http://google.com "Correct Hashcodes")

**Use cases** <br/>

### TreeSet
This is a set that is also based on another data structure in Java, the *TreeMap*.
Basically, we have a binary tree, keeping the elements in a specified sort order.

To keep elements in order, we need to do one of two things:
- Put the elements in a TreeSet which implements the *Comparable* interface.
- Use a *Comparator* interface to define the order for the *TreeSet*, we pass it in the constructor of the *TreeSet*.

***Note from Moamen:*** If you have trouble understanding what a Binary Tree is, there will be a course on Data Structures that will cover Hash tables in theoretical detail :smile:

### EnumSets
These are sets that only allow us to store **enum** objects, it's based on a data structure called a *bitset*.

In an enum, each element has an order associated with it, like { ONE=1, TWO=2, ...}, that number is used by the *bitset*.

The bitset takes the space of a primitive *long* variable (And some more), then assigns each enum number to a bit in the *long* space that it has.
So it's basically a wrapper for a *long* variable 

where it takes that number and says "that number is the nth bit in a long

EnumSet is rarely used, so we won't cover it in details, but we'll explore it a little.

### Performance Comparison of Set Implementations
Here is the algorithm performance of Set implementations for common methods. <br/>
![Set Implementation Performance Comparison](../static/Set-implementation-big-o.png "Set Implementation Performance Comparison")

### SortedSet and NavigableSet
A SortedSet and NavigableSet are both two subinterfaces of Set, the additional feature is that elements are ordered, so we can:
- Retrieve first and last elements.
- Retrieve subSets starting from an element to the end (inclusive), or from the beginning to an element (exclusive), or from an element to another element (Like the subList but using actual elements, not indicesm, and also the first element is included and the last element is not included).

NavigableSet extends SortedSet and gives us ways to move through the set itself.
The *TreeSet* is actually an implementation of *NavigableSet*, therefore it also implements *SortedSet* and *Set*.

Check out the full list of methods by all the interfaces we discussed:
- Set: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html
- SortedSet: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html
- NavigableSet: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/NavigableSet.html

As well as all the implementations:
- HashSet: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html
- TreeSet: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html
- EnumSet: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/EnumSet.html

## Stacks and Queues
### Queues
Queues are FIFO data structures, elements that come in first, go out first.

When we add something to a queue, we face a small problem: Queues can have bounded capacity, or maximum number of elements i.e. they can get *full*.
If we use the normal *add()* method defined by Collection interface, if the queue is full, it throws an exception.
So, we need a different method to add elements to the queue.
The same goes for removing from the queue, it can get empty, and the method *remove()* throws an exception in that case.

So what do we do?
- Use other methods, like:
    + offer(): it's like the *add()* method but returns *false* if the queue is full.
    + poll(): it's like the *remove()* method but returns *null* if the queue is empty.

But, if your logic expects the queue to never be empty, it's better to use *remove()* because it being empty is a logic bug, so let it throw an exception so you can debug it.

Additional methods for the queue:
- element(): looks at the first element to be removed from the queue and returns it, it throws and exception if the queue is empty.
- peek(): the same as *element()* but returns null and doesn't throw and exception if the queue is empty. 

Let's go through an example. Let's say you bought a new mobile phone and it has problems, so you call the IT or the Help Desk of the company to get it fixed. Other customers do that too, so the Help Desk gets a lot of messages.

We'll implement a class for HelpDesk to define its behavior and logic of replying to message in order

Look here:
``` Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>(); // Don't worry about the implementation for now

    q.push(4);
    q.push(5);
    q.push(2);
    q.push(3);

    int i;

    while((i = q.poll()) != null) {
        System.out.print(i + ", "); // this will print 4, 5, 2, 3,
    }
}
```

**Use cases of queues:** <br/>
- Queues are very useful in messaging between different classes, objects, modules, or even entire applications, especially web applications.

### Priority Queues
This is a queue but each element has a *priority* value, the items here don't come out of the queue FIFO-style, but according to their *priority* value.

Priority is basically us specifying the order of elements to go out of the queue.

### Deques
This is a queue where we can remove elements out of the queue FIFO-style, or LIFO-style.
Basically this can implement the *Stack* data structure.

There was a java.util.Stack implementation of the stack, but that was deprecated. Why would they deprecate such a fundamental data structure?
Because it wasn't very good really. It synchronized all the methods and it tried to be thread-safe, where most of the stack operations don't require threads anyway, so this class had performance overhead for no reason.

So, Java introduced the Deque interface. A double-ended queue:
- We can add and remove from the *head*, LIFO-style.
- We can add and remove from the *tail*, LIFO-style.
- We can add from the *head* and remove from the *tail*, FIFO-style.
- We can add from the *tail* and remove from the *head*, FIFO-style.

So, we have methods to do this:
- *addFirst()* and *offerFirst():* these methods add elements at the *head* of the queue.
- *addLast()* and *offerLast():* these methods add elements at the *tail* of the queue.
- *removeFirst()* and *pollFirst():* these methods remove elements at the *head* of the queue.
- *removeLast()* and *pollLast():* these methods remove elements at the *tail* of the queue.

For peeking, we have the methods:
- *getFirst()* and *peekFirst():* these peek at the *head* of the queue.
- *getLast()* and *peekLast():* these peek at the *tail* of the queue.

We don't have to worry about all that if we'll use a Deque as a stack, there are the two famous methods:
- *push().*
- *pop().*

The Deque interface extends the Queue interface, so we can still use offer(), poll(), peek(), etc.

Let's use the Deque to implement a calculator:
- First, we'll create a class Calculator.
- It has a method evaluate(String input), which takes a string input of the mathematical expression, like "11 + 2"
- Inside the method, we want to:
    + Split the input string into tokens.
    + Add them all into a Stack.
    + Repeat until Stack is empty:
        - Pop the first 3 elements.
        - Perform the operation indicated by the 2nd element on the 1st and 3rd element.
        - Push the result on the stack.
    + Return the final result.
``` Java
public class Calculator {

## Maps
Map is the only collection that does **Not** extend the interface Collection, because it has key/value pairs, its add, remove, and other method don't quite fit with Collection.

### Why use maps

**Map methods** <br/>

### SortedMap and NavigableMap

### HashMap

### LinkedHashMap

### TreeMap

### WeakHashMap

### EnumMap

### Performance Comparison

## Algorithms and Operations on Collections
Now, we'll explore some operations that can be done on any Collection in Java.
These operations are defined in the interface *java.util.Collections*, with an *s*.

There are three types of these operations:
- Algorithms: like sorting, shuffling, etc.
- Factories: methods which create new collection and view instances.
- Utilities: these are convenience methods that just make life better.

### Algorithms on Collections
**Rotate:** <br/>
This algorithm takes a list, takes the last element, moves it to the beginning, then shifts all the other elements by one element. Basically it's a circular shift.

**Shuffling** <br/>
*Everyday I'm shuffling..* <br/>
This algorithm takes a list and sorts the elements in a random way, just like shuffling a deck of cards.

**Sorting** <br/>

### Factories of Collections
So far, when we made Collections, we made them using constructor. Here we'll use Factories.

### Utilities for Colletions
