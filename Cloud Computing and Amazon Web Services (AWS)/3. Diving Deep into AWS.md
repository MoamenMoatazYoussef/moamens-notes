## AWS Account Basics
### AWS Free Tier
To be able to work with AWS, we'll need an AWS accout.
AWS provides something called AWS Free Tier, it's an option to use AWS resources to get some AWS experience at no cost.
Check out the documentation here:
https://amzn.to/2YEjP2f
To use AWS Free Tier, we'll need to create an AWS account.

### Create an AWS Account
To make an account, go to AWS website and choose Create AWS account, now you'll need:
- An email
- credit card info (even if you'll use the free subscription)
- Address
- Phone number, with the extension of your country
- Other personal info

***Note:*** AWS will draw 1$ from you bank account for verification then will return it once verification happens, don't worry about that.

In the middle, you'll receive an automated call from Amazon asking for a 4-digit number that will appear on your screen, enter it in the call and it will verify your identity.

Then, select Basic Plan (which is free). <br/>

Congrats, now you have an AWS account :smile: <br/>

Sign in to the console, and there you go :smile: <br/>

**Using the AWS Console** <br/>
The AWS Console is where you manage any of the AWS services that you'll use.

You can access an AWS service by searching in the search bar above, or choose it from the giant list in front of you.

Check out the service *Billing*, and the service *CloudWatch*.

**AWS Documentation** <br/>
Open the *Support* menu on the top right, you'll find Documentation, this is the official documentation of AWS.

Now, let's dive into the services of AWS :smile:
