# AWS Services - Elastic Cloud Compute EC2

## Basics of EC2
### EC2 Overview
An EC2 instances is basically a computer that resides in the AWS cloud at one of the AWS data centers. <br/>

Basically it's the hardware where your code and database reside.

If you play a game on your PC, that's a normal scenario, but if you don't want to run the game on the PC, but still play it, then you can put the game on the AWS cloud and run it on the cloud.

When you do that, your game is running on one of the computers that AWS has in its data centers, that computer is called an EC2 instance, your game is running on an EC2 instance.

So, when we think about an EC2 instance, we still think about things like:
- The OS:
    + it's called an *Amazon Machine Image*, or ***AMI***, we load an ***AMI*** on an EC2 instance so that we can get access to the EC2 instance's OS.
- The processing power of its CPU:
    + It's called an ***Instance Type***.
- The hard drive:
    + EC2 instances use something called *Elastic Block Storage* or ***EBS***, this is the hard drive of the EC2 instances.
- The RAMs: it's like the normal RAM.
- The IP addressing: a virtual network adapter that gives us internet access on our EC2 instance.
- Firewall:
    + ***Security Groups***: we use them to select which ports to allow, etc.

As you can see, EC2 instances are just computers (with some fancy terms) owned and operated by AWS that we use to run our stuff.

As a client, we can purchase the EC2 service in two options:
- On-demand: we're charged when the EC2 instance is running, and we're billed by the hour.
- Reserved instances: we purchase an EC2 instance for a set period of time, up to 3 years.
- Spot pricing: we bid on instance types, then we pay for it only if it's equal to or below our price.

## Let's build a PC
### Windows or Linux
What the hell is an *AMI*? <br/>
An AMI is a bundle that includes the OS, additional applications, and any settings we might need on the EC2 instances.

We specify an AMI when we launch the EC2 instance, it's like a starter or a template for the instance.

If you have a PC with Windows, some games, and user settings, and there was somehow a way to wrap up your Windows, games, and settings in a bundle, then use that bundle on another PC when it's starting, so that when the PC starts up it shows your Windows, it has your Games, and it has your settings.

That bundle is the same concept as the *AMI*.

We can make different instances of the same AMI.

When we create an AMI, we create a template that we can use to launch EC2 instances with the same configuration, OS, and applications, as the instance we used to create the AMI.

There are three types of AMIs:
1. Community AMI.
2. Marketplace AMI.
3. My AMIs.

**A) Community AMI** <br/>
These are free to use, we just select an OS that we want.

Open the AWS console:
- Go to EC2.
- Choose Launch instance.
- The list that opened in front of you to choose an AMI, all of these are AMIs, with their own OS and other stuff you might need.
- Choose Community AMIs.
- Notice that the AMIs in the list mostly contain only the OS.

**B) AWS Marketplace AMI** <br/>
In the list you opened,
- Choose AWS Marketplace AMIs.
- These are AMIs with OSs and other stuff, these are paid for.

**C) My AMI** <br/>
These are the ones that you create by yourself.

### The Specs of your PC
Remember, the EC2 instance has many settings:
- The OS, or the AMI.
- The processing power of its CPU, It's called an ***Instance Type***.
- The hard drive.
- The RAMs.
- The IP addressing.
- Firewall.

**So what is an *Instance Type*?** <br/>
Let's imagine three PCs:
- PC1:
    + CPU: Core i7
    + RAM: 16 GB
    + Graphics Card: Nvidia GTX 1080 titan.
- PC2:
    + CPU: Pentium Dual-core
    + RAM: 6 GB
    + Graphics Card: Intel G43 Express Chipset
- PC3:
    + CPU: Pentium 2
    + RAM: 512 MB
    + Graphics Card: embedded in the CPU.

The first PC looks awesome, it's a gaming PC and it's a powerful one. The second one is a bit old, it's a barely working PC. The third one is essentially in a museum or something xD

Why did we divide them like that? <br/>
Because the specs of the first PC are a powerful package for games. The specs of the second PC are an old package. The third one is basically trash.

The *powerful package*, the group of awesome PC specs, can be bundled together and called *gaming specs*.

In AWS, you can get EC2 instances but what about their hardware and specs?
Well you're offered some bundles of specs, called ***Instance Types***.

In the AWS dashboard,
- Go to EC2
- Launch Instance.
- Choose one of the AMIs, for example the Amazon Linux AMI free tier eligible.
- The next screen will show a list of *Instance Types*, as you can see, there's CPU type, RAM, etc.
- It's even divided into families like General Purpose, GPU Optimized, etc.

#### The Hard Drive of your PC
In the list of instance types, we'll see that some of them have a storage that's labeled EBS, short for *Elastic Block Storage*.

EBS is a storage for your EC2 instance. Basically it's the hard drive of your EC2 instance.

*They are virtual drives that we create*, we can create EBS volumes and  they can be connected to any EC2 instance in the same availability zone, that's how they are *elastic*.

The performance of an EBS volume is measured by ***IOPS***, *Input/output Operations Per Second*, the higher IOPS, the better performance, the unit of measure by KiB.

What determines high IOPS? <br/>
- EBS volume size.

In the AWS Console, 
- EC2
- Launch Instance
- Choose an AMI.
- Choose an Instance Type.
- You'll see the Step 4: Add Storage section, you can see the volumes that we can create.

We can create EBS volumes separately and attach them to EC2 instances.

#### The Firewall of your PC
To protect your EC2, you use a virtual firewall that blocks or allows traffic based on some rules, this virtual firewall is called a *Security Group*.

When we launch an EC2 instance, we associate one or more of these firewalls (these *Security Groups*) to it, so they protect it.

We can add or remove rules from these firewalls, and they will be automatically applied.

Remember the Network Access Control List or *NACL*? The difference between it and these firewalls (*Security Groups*) is that we can only create *Allow* rules for *Security Groups*, but we can create *Allow* and *Deny* rules for the *NACL*.

In the EC2 Dashboard, on the left panel, 
- go to Security Groups.
- There will be a default Security Group, created when we create the default VPC when we create our AWS account.
- It's a default one and it has default values:
    + All data coming from outside is denied.
    + All data going from our EC2 instance to the outside is allowed. 
- There are two types of Rules for *Security Groups*:
    + **Inbound Rules**: rules that apply to incoming traffic.
    + **Outbound Rules**: rules that apply to outgoing traffic.
- Click on Create Security Group.
- Here, in the Inbound tab, there are no rules set which means that no inbound data is allowed from outside. (We must have *Allow* rules)
- In the Outbound tab, we'll notice that in the rules, the protocol is set to *All*, which means that all data going to outside is allowed.


- In the Inbound tab, click on Add Rule:
    + Type: HTTP.
    + Protocol: TCP.
    + Port Range: 80.
    + Source: Custom.
    + 0.0.0.0.80.
- This means that any inbound traffic from port 80 will be allowed.


Security Groups are *stateful*: If a packet of data is allowed inside, it will be able to leave **EVEN IF** we have outbound rules preventing that.

We only create *Allow* rules in Security Groups.
