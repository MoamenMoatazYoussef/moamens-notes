## First Steps
Jest is a library that is designed to test Javascript code, especially React.js components.

In this course, we'll explore how we can use Jest to test our React code.

**Alright, let's get the show on the road** <br/>
- First, create a new react app, call it tdd-react, just type this in a terminal:
``` sh
$ npm init react-app tdd-react
```
- Wait for it to finish.
- Open it, in the src directory, we've seen all these files before, but there's a file we're interested in now: *App.test.js*, open it.
- You'll see this inside it:
``` js
it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```
