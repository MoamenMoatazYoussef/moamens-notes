# Moamen's Notes

Hello :raising_hand: 
My name is Moamen Moataz, I'm a full-stack web developer at ITWorx Egypt. I specialize in ReactJs, Bootstrap, Spring Framework, and Hibernate.

I've struggled a lot with training courses, books, and learning material that is hard to understand, or uses too many technical words.

All developers go through the same problem, therefore I decided that **I will develop *free* written courses in the easiest, most organized way possible**, using basic everyday terms and examples whenever I can, and including as much details as possible.

These courses are:
1. Free.
2. Constantly updated with new releases.
3. Are compiled from all the sources that I use. 
3. Have code examples from the sources and other code examples that I tried. All the code examples are tested and are working.
4. Have references to the sources, and any other useful references, like Stackoverflow links, etc.
5. Open for editing i.e. you can edit in them.

In the next few months, I will:
1. Add code exercises and use cases to practice.
2. Add one or two projects for each course to practice.
3. Organize the courses in roadmaps: *Frontned*, *Backend*, *Fullstack*, *Cloud Computing in AWmazon Web Services*, and *Theoretical* roadmap. 


Long-term plans:
1. Build a team to cover more technologies and more material.
2. This is my ultimate purpose, to *create a library of scripts that helps software developers learn things more easily and efficiently*.

This repo contains **all the courses that I ever wrote**.

Enjoy :smile:
