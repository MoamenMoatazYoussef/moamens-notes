# Moamen's Notes

Hello :raising_hand: 
My name is Moamen Moataz, I'm a full-stack web developer at ITWorx Egypt. I specialize in ReactJs, Bootstrap, Spring Framework, and Hibernate.

I've struggled a lot with training courses, books, and learning material that is hard to understand, or uses too many technical words, at the same time I need to write notes in order to concentrate and fully understand what I'm learning.

All software developers go through the same problem, therefore I decided that instead of notes, **I'll write full scripts in the easiest, most organized way possible**, using basic everyday terms and examples whenever I can, and including as much details as possible.

This repo contains **all the notes & scripts that I ever wrote**, my purpose is to *create a library of scripts that help beginner and intermediate software developers learn things more easily and efficiently*, enjoy :smile:
