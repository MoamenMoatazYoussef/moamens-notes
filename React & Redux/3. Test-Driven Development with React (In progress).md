## Wait what?
By now you've worked with some frontend technologies like JS and React, and you may have even worked with Redux.
You may have felt that, wow, frontend development is complex, it involves a lot of events, situations, logic, and a lot of stuff.

It's hard to be bombarded with all of that and still maintain good quality code, but *what is good quality code anyway?*

There are a lot of definitions of *good quality code*, some say it should be *readable*, some say it should be *easy to change*, some say it should be *easy to delete* and so on.

One of the greatest software engineers, *Robert C. Martin*, also known as *Uncle Bob*, wrote about it in his *Clean* book series:
- In the book *The Clean Coder*, he stated that you, as a developer, should **never** deliver any code that you're not *confident* about.
- In the book *Clean Architecture*, he talked about the design principles of code, how code should be *modularized* to achieve all of what people say: readibility, ease of deletion and extension, etc.

*Modularized* means that the code should be divided into small individual parts like puzzle pieces, each performs a specific function, and they are interchangeable, meaning we can swap them, take some of them outside the program and put them in another program, etc.

***Note from Moamen:*** I highly recommend his series: *The Clean Coder*, *Clean Code*, *Clean Architecture*, In the future I'll write notes for them and put some practice cases so that if you want to practice what he preaches in his books, you have some use cases :smile:

So how do we achieve both things?
How do we become *confident* in our code and make it *modularized*?
**How do we write good quality code?** <br/>
A question with no right or wrong answer, but Uncle Bob proposed a way of programming to make this possible, it's not a new technology, it's not a new library, it's how you as a developer write your code. It's called ***Test-Driven Development***, or ***TDD***.

In this course, we'll learn:
- How to write unit tests.
- How to use a React testing library called Jest to test React components.
- How to write code in this ***TDD*** way in React using Jest.

## First steps in TDD React
Alright, let's get the show on the road,
- First, create a new react app, call it tdd-react, just type this in a terminal:
``` sh
$ npm init react-app tdd-react
```
- Wait for it to finish.
- Open it, in the src directory, we've seen all these files before, but there's a file we're interested in now: *App.test.js*, open it.
- You'll see this inside it:
``` js
it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```

**So what is that?** <br/>
The App.test.js is a test file, a file to write unit tests for our React code.


**How do we run the test?** <br/>
cd into the project directory and try running this command:
``` sh
npm test
```
You'll see some logs saying that some tests succeeded, you just ran the code in the App.test.js, anything that has the extension *.test.js* runs when we run the command *npm test*.
So, we can write all our unit tests in *.test.js* files then run all of them with *npm test*, that's convenient.

Open the App.js file, you'll see this code as usual:
``` js
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
- Remove the header element, so the code is now like this:
``` js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
- Run *npm test* again.

You'll see logs saying that the test **still** succeedes. **What the hell?**

Let's look deeper into the test code:
``` js
it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```
This is a ***Jest*** code, ***Jest*** is a framework for testing, made specifically for React, we can use it to test React components.

Now, we see an unusual keyword *it*, what is that? <br/>
*it* is a Jest function to test something in React, it takes three arguments:
- Unit test name: this is a name given to the test.
- Unit test function: this is the function that contains the actual testing code.
- Unit test Timeout [optional]: the unit test function may take some time to return a value, Jest can wait indefinitely or wait a set amount of time before deciding that this test failed, we can pass a time value in this argument to set that amount of time.

In our case:
- The name of the test is *renders without crashing*, we can see that this just tests the the App component renders without problems, if it doesn't render or a problem happened, the test fails.
- The function does three things:
    + Creates a div element.
    + Tries to render the App component in that div element.
    + Unmounts everything to return to the normal state.
- There is no timeout value.

So, this code tests that the App components successfully renders, regardless of what's inside it, that why when we removed the header and ran the test, the test still succeeded.

**But we want to test that the header also renders, what do we do?** <br/>
Simple: we create a component for it, then we test that new component.

BUT, before you get to work, we'll actually work in a different way, actually, we'll work in the *Test-Driven Development* way:
- Create a new file, *Header.test.js* (A test file).
- Copy the code from App.test.js to the new file, changing App to Header like this:
``` js
it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<Header />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```
- Now, run *npm test*.
Now, we have two tests that ran, and one of them **failed**, and that's what we wanted. <br/>

..*yay?* :smile: <br/>

Well, obviously it failed, because we didn't write the Header component yet. <br/>

**Creating the Header** <br/>
- Create a new file Header.js, the actual code file.
- Write this code inside it:
``` js
class Header extends React.Component {

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <header className="App-header">
                    <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
                    <p>
                        Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.</p>
                    <a
                        className="App-link"
                        href="https://reactjs.org"
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >
                        Learn React
                    </a>
                </header>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
export default Header;
```

Then, render the Header component into the App component, open the App.js file:
``` js
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
- Now, run *npm test*.
- Well, look at that, both tests succeeded because now the Header component renders :smile:

**What's the thing to learn here?** <br/>
What we did is very easy compared to what we've gone through before in the React and React-redux course.
It's not about the code, it's about the order we wrote the code in:
1. First, we wrote the *unit test* of the Header component, the Header.test.js file.
2. Then, we ran the test expecting it to fail, and that's what happened.
3. Then, we changed our code so that the *unit test* we created succeeds.

Notice that I didn't say the details of *changing the code*, I just said that we changed it so that the new unit test succeeds.

This is ***Test-Driven Development***, this is how we write code in ***TDD***. When you're going to write any function, class, component, and so on:
1. First, divide your code into small blocks that you want to test.
2. Then, follow this procedure:
    + **Step 1:** Take the first *small block of code*, and write a unit test for it.
    + **Step 2:** Run the test to see that it fails.
    + **Step 3:** Write the small block of code to pass that test, until you feel you are confident.
    + **Step 4:** Re-run the test:
        - If it *succeeds*, improve the test to contain the second *small block of code*, then repeat Steps 2 to 4.
        - If it *fails*, repeat Step 3 and 4 until it succeeds.
3. Integrate the small blocks of code together to make the big block of code you wanted to write in the first place.

When you do this, you'll create *small code blocks that do specific functions*, and you are *confident* about them since *you are sure each one passed its test(s)*.

We can see that this *TDD* way of writing code inherently drives us to write *good quality code*.

Sure this process may take more time from you than the normal way of just writing your code, but it sames **much** more time in the long-run when you're testing and integrating a big project.

Also, it improves your skills of programming and unit testing, and it may even make you friends with your QA colleagues :smile:

TDD is like going to the gym, it's a habit that needs *Deliberate Practice* to build and maintain, until it's just part of your daily life.

In this course we'll write code that may bu much simpler than what we wrote during previous courses, because now we're not learning a technology, we're in the TDD Gym trying to learn this habit.

***Note from Moamen:*** In my small experience, I've seen few people attempt to write good quality code (in any way, not only TDD), and I've rarely seen people work with TDD, in my opinion TDD will give you a good edge in the industry, if you use it to create a brand that you write good quality code, you'll open a lot of opportunities for yourself.

***Note from Moamen:*** I also practice TDD and I like to practice it in open-source projects that I do by myself, if you want to work on them and practice TDD, or you just want to practice TDD, you can join me, contact me using *moamen.moataz.youssef@gmail.com*.

## Test-Driven Development
In the Software Testing universe, there are some words we need to know:
- **Suite**: A set of tests for a single unit of code.
- **Spec**: A single test in a suite.
- **Assertion**: A boolean question that produces True or False, used to test if something produces an expected value.
- **Matcher**: Things that *assertions* use to match values together.
- **Test Runner**: A software that runs the specs and suites.

Let's say we want to test this JS function:
``` js
function welcome(friendName = "Friend") {
    return (`Welcome, ${friendName}!`);
}
```

We'll write a test *suite* for this function using Jest:
- First, we'll use a Jest function called describe(), it's a function that inside it we write different unit tests for a piece of code, in our case, for the function welcome().
``` js
describe("welcome") {

}
```
- Inside this, we'll write different single tests, or *specs*, using the *it* function that we saw earlier, for example:
``` js
describe("welcome") {
    it("Contacts the name that we pass to it") {

    }
}
```
- Now, inside this test, we want to do three things:
    + Specify the expected value of the function we're testing.
    + Use the function to get an actual value.
    + Compare the two values i.e. *match* them, and assert if they match or not.
``` js
describe("welcome") {
    it("Contacts the name that we pass to it") {

        // Here's the expected value
        let expected = `Welcome, Moamen!`;

        // Here we get the value returned from the function
        let actual = welcome("Moamen");

        // Here, the expect() function is an assertion, if it fails, the test fails
        // toEqual() is a matcher, it matches the value passed to expect() to the value passed to it
        // In our case, we expect the actual value to be the same as the expected one.
        // So, we pass the actual value into expect() and the expected value into toEqual() 
        expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
    }
}
```
- Let's add one more test for the case of not passing any value to the function welcome().
``` js
describe("welcome") {
    it("Contacts the name that we pass to it") {
        let expected = `Welcome, Moamen!`;
        let actual = welcome("Moamen");
        expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
    }

    it(`Contacts "Friend" when nothing is passed`) {
        let expected = `Welcome, Friend!`;
        let actual = welcome();
        expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
    }
}
```

### How to make good tests
To make good tests for a code unit, say a function for example, we need to ask ourselves two questions:
1. What should we test?
2. What makes a good test?

**What should we test?** <br/>
This is a big question, but in React and Frontend we'll mainly look into these:
- Does it render?
- Does it render correctly?
- Does it handle events correctly?
- Do all conditionals work?
- Are edge cases handled?

**What makes a good test?** <br/>
To write good tests, they also must be written carefully, but we don't need a lot of complexity, just follow these guidelines:
- Each test should be independent of other tests.
- If you're testing a separate behavior, test it in one test, no need to test it many times.
- Don't test something you don't need to test.
- Test only one code unit at a time.
- Avoid unnecessary preconditions.

**How to pass the test?** <br/>
Now onto step 2, there are three ways to do this:
- **Way 1**: Write code in the function to make the test pass, no matter how bad the code inside the function is, we can refactor it later.
- **Way 2**: Write a clean solution. (Don't try too hard in this, you're already writing tests and modularizing your code, trying to write every bit of code cleanly is good but can be time-consuming)
- **Way 3**: If only one test fails, use Way 1, if more than one test, use Way 2.
