## Tips

## What is Spring MVC?
- A framework for building Web apps in Java.
- Based on MVC.
- Leverages Core Spring framework.

The full documentation of Spring MVC (Which is very good btw):
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html

Books:
Just search Spring MVC on amazon, you'll find a lot of good books.

## Components of Spring MVC
- A set of web pages to layout UI components.
- A collection of Spring Beans.
- Spring configurations.

So how does Spring MVC work behind the scenes?
- An incoming request occurs.
- A component called "Front Controller" or "DispatcherServlet" that will delegate the request to other objects in our system.
- It's part of the Spring framework.
- Already developed and in the JAR files we loaded.
- WE create the Model, View, and Controller classes.
	- Model: contain data.
	- View: the JSP page where data is rendered.
	- Controller: The business logic.
	
Controller:
- This is the business logic, here we handle requests, store/retrieve data, place them in model, etc.
- Send that to the appropriate view template.

Model:
- The local container that contains the data.
- Stores and retrieve data from databases or web services.
- It can be any java object or collection.

View:
- View templates and model data, where our JSP page reads the model data and displays it.
- Most commonly is JSP + JSTL.
- There are other view templates like Groovy, Velocity, Thymeleaf, Freemarker, etc. Check the docs.

## Setting Up Spring MVC
We already did these:
- Install Tomcat.
- Install Eclipse.
- Connect Eclipse to Tomcat.

Now we'll do two more steps:
- Download Spring MVC source code for this training.
http://www.luv2code.com/downloads/udemy-spring-hibernate/solution-code-spring-mvc-config-files.zip
- Download the latest Spring JAR viles from the Spring website.

## Spring MVC Configuration
This is probably the hardest part of Spring MVC: getting the config right.

Steps:
- Add configurations to the file WEB-INF/web.xml
	- Configure Spring MVC Dispatcher Servlet.
	- Set up URL mappings to that Servlet.
- Add configurations to file WEB-INF/spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml
	- Add support for Spring component scanning, conversion, formatting, valudation.
	- Configure Spring MVC View Resolver.

**Note:** I messed up many times on these steps, which caused errors in Tomcat and stuff, so **concentrate** :'D

**Configuration: JAR Files
***Note:*** These files usually cause a lot of problems since configuring them isn't easy, but these ones are pre-configured, use them until you get good at configuring them.

1. Change your Eclipse perspective:
Open the Window menu -> Perspective -> Open Perspective -> Java EE

2. Create a new project:
File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project
Call it "spring-mvc-demo"

3. Open the project tree , you'll find a folder called WebContent, inside it WEB-INF/lib. 

4. Add the spring JAR files (We added those before) in the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib folder in the project. (Anything in WEB-INF is automatically on the build path, so don't worry about adding them manually)

5. Go to this path in the Spring MVC files we downloaded earlier:
./solution-code-spring-mvc-config-files\solution-code-spring-mvc-config-files\spring-mvc\starter-files\spring-mvc-demo\lib

Inside you'll find three JAR files:
commons-logging ... .jar
and two other files called javax.servlet.jsp.jstl ...

ONLY COPY THE TWO javax.servlet.jsp.jstl files, DO NOT COPY the commons-logging file.

Copy the two files and put them in WEB-INF/lib directory in the project.

**Configuration: Config Files
6. Go to this path:
./solution-code-spring-mvc-config-files\solution-code-spring-mvc-config-files\spring-mvc\starter-files\spring-mvc-demo\config

7. Copy those two files: 
- web.xml 
- spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml
And paste them in WEB-INF directly, **NOT in the lib**.

8. Open web.xml, you'll find the steps we discussed earlier.

9. Open spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml, which is a regular config file for Spring, also the configs we discussed earlier are viewed here.

10. Create the folder 'view' in WEB-INF directly, **not in the lib**.

So WEB-INF now has 4 items:
- lib: which has Spring JAR files and ONLY TWO Spring MVC Files.
- view: an empty folder for now.
- web.xml
- spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml

Now , hopefully, Spring MVC should be configured and ready to go, we'll start writing code next.

## Spring MVC: Creating Controllers and Views
Steps:
- Create controller class.
- Define controller method.
- Add request mapping to the controller method.
- Return the view name.
- Develop view page.

We'll use @Controller annotation, which inherits from @Component, so it will be picked up during component scanning.

**Step 1: Create controller class**<br/>
Create a new package in Java Resources/src, call it "com.luv2code.springdemo.mvc".
Create a new class, called "HomeController".
Add the @Controller to the class
``` Java
@Controller
public class HomeController {

}
```
**Step 2: Define controller method**<br/>
Add a new method to the controller:
``` Java
@Controller
public class HomeController {
	public String showPage() {
		return null;
	}
}
```
**Step 3: Add request mapping to the controller method**<br/>
Add the annotation @RequestMapping and pass "\" as argument:
``` Java
@Controller
public class HomeController {
	
	@RequestMapping("/")
	public String showPage() {
		return null;
	}
}
```
**Step 4: Return the view name**<br/>
Return the name of the page (the incomplete name of the page because the prefix and suffix are added from spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml )
``` Java
@Controller
public class HomeController {
	
	@RequestMapping("/")
	public String showPage() {
		return "main-menu";
	}
}

```
**Step 5: Develop view page**<br/>
In the WebContent/WEB-INF/view folder, create a new file, name it <the-view-name-you-returned-in-last-step>.jsp, here it's "main-menu.jsp".
Inside it, write any html you want like:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
	<title>Moamen's Spring MVC</title>
</head>

<body>
	<span>Moamen is amazing</span>
</body>
```

***Note:*** If you see an error at !DOCTYPE that says "the superclass javax.servlet.http.httpservlet was not found on the java build path", right click on the project -> Properties -> Project Facets -> open Runtime tab -> check the box next to Apache Tomcat -> Apply & close.

Now right-click on the project folder, Run as Run on server, choose default server, click finish.

You'll see your page opening (Hopefully, if not then check configuration xD).

***Note:*** If you see an error because of ports, double click on Tomcat in eclipse Servers section, set the Tomcat Admin Port to be DIFFERENT FROM the HTTP port.

## Reading Form Data with Spring MVC
If we have a form, the user enters some data and submits it, it'll go to our Spring MVC app, which will show a confirmation page.

Flow of the application:
- They enter /showForm (to show the JSP form).
- This goes to our controller.
- Form is shown.
- They enter data and submit.
- Data is passed to /processForm request mapping.
- Which goes to controller.
- Controller passes back confirmation page.

So, we'll use ONE controller that has TWO request mappings.

How does that look like?
The controller will have two methods, each will be annotated by @RequestMapping(here we put the mapping).
So, one for /showForm, and one for /processForm.

Steps:
- Create controller class.
- Create controller method to show HTML form, annotate it with /showForm
- Create the view page for the HTML form.
- Create controller method to process HTML form, annotate it with /processForm
- Create the view page for confirmation.

**Step 1: Create controller class**<br/>
Create a new class, call it "HelloWorldController".

**Step 2: Create controller method to show HTML form**<br/>
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/showForm")
public String showForm() {
	return "form";
}
```

**Step 3: Create the view page for the HTML form**<br/>
Create a new File in WEB-INF/view, call it "form.jsp" (according to the name returned from the controller method that's mapped to it).
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My form</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<form action="processForm" method="GET">
			<input type="text" 	name="studentName"
				placeholder="What's your name?" />
			
			<input type="submit" />
		</form>
	</body>
</html>
```

Run the project, change the url to:
http://localhost:8091/spring-mvc-demo/showForm
to check it out.

If we hit submit, we'll get the most famous error on the planet: 404 not found.
That's because processForm isn't made yet :'D

**Step 4: Create controller method to process HTML form**<br/>
Create a controller method in HelloWorldController and map it to "/processForm"
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/processForm")
public String processForm() {
	return "confirm";
}
```

**Step 5: Create the view page for confirmation**<br/>
In the WEB-INF/view folder, create the view page for confirmation called "confirm.jsp", then write it:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Data is received</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Congrats ${param.studentName}, you submitted successfully, you can push buttons, WOW!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

Notice that we passed the data that was submitted into the HTML, param.studentName, remember that "studentName" was the name we gave to the input form.

Now run it, go to the page /showForm, enter your name, submit, and see the result.

Nice. ;) <br />

But, you may wonder, can we just open on the showForm page from a link in the main page?
Yes of course, *mon ami*, do this with me *s'il vous plait*.

Go to *le* file main-menu.jsp, set up *un* anchor tag, and set *le* href attribute in *le* anchor tag to:
``` html
<a href="showForm">Click to go to the form</a>
```

Then run *le* project and see *ils* result.
*Voila! mon ami*, *le* link is *le* working.
*french laugh*

## Adding Data to Spring Model
We covered the Controller and the View templates, but how do we interact with the model?

The model is just a data container.
We can put ANYTHING in the model: strings, objects, info from data base, etc.
We can load it up.
View templates (jsp) can access it.

Steps:
- Create a new method to process form data.
- Read the form data.
- Convert it to uppercase and create a message using the uppercase data.
- Add THAT to the model and return a page name.
- Make the View display the data we wrote in the model.
- Modify the form to map to the NEW method, not the old one.

The method will have a mapping to a new View page.
and it will receive two arguments: HttpServletRequest, and Model.

The HttpServletRequest holds form data.
The model is, well, the model xD

The model is initially empty, we can add data to it, we can add any kind of data together btw, Lists, Strings, user-defined classes, etc. 

So, the method will:
- First, read the form data.
- Convert it to uppercase.
- Create a message using the uppercase data.
- Add the message to the model in the form of key/value.
- return a page name.

Now, creating the new View page:
- To access data, we use ${key}, where key is the key we used to save the message to the model.

Review of Steps:
1. Create a new method to process form data.
2. Read the form data.
3. Convert it to uppercase and create a message using the uppercase data.
4. Add THAT to the model and return a page name.
5. Make the View display the data we wrote in the model.

**Step 1: Create a new method to process form data**<br/>
In HelloWorldController, add the new method.
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/processFormVersionTwo")
public String processFormUppercase(HttpServletRequest request, Model model) {
	
}
```

**Step 2: Read the form data**<br/>
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/processFormVersionTwo")
public String processFormUppercase(HttpServletRequest request, Model model) {
	String theName = request.getParameter("studentName");
}
```

**Step 3: Convert it to uppercase and create a message using the uppercase data**<br/>
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/processFormVersionTwo")
public String processFormUppercase(HttpServletRequest request, Model model) {
	String theName = request.getParameter("studentName");
	theName = theName.toUpperCase();
	String message = "Yo!" + theName;
}
```

**Step 4: Add THAT to the model and return a page name**<br/>
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/processFormVersionTwo")
public String processFormUppercase(HttpServletRequest request, Model model) {
	String theName = request.getParameter("studentName");
	theName = theName.toUpperCase();
	String message = "Yo!" + theName;model.addAttribute("message", message);
	return "confirm";
}
```

**Step 5: Make the View display the data we wrote in the model**<br/>
Now go to confirm.jsp:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Data is received</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Congrats ${param.studentName}, you submitted successfully, you can push buttons, WOW!</h1>
		<h2>${message}
	</body>
</html>
```

**Step 6: Modify the form to map to the NEW method, not the old one**<br/>
Go to form.jsp:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My form</title>
</head>
<body>
	<form action="processFormVersionTwo" method="GET">
		<input type="text" name="studentName"
			placeholder="What's your name?" />
			
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>
</body>
</html>
```

*le* Work is *le* nice, *mon ami*, give a round of applause for *vous-mêmes, s'il vous-plait* ;) :sunglasses: <br />

## How to use CSS, JS, and Images in Spring MVC
These are static resources, any static resource is processed as a URL mapping in Spring MVC.

In WebContent, create a new folder "resources", or "assets", or whatever you want.
In it, create a folder for css, one for js, one for images (one per static resource type).
In spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml, add this:
``` xml
<mvc:resources mapping="/resources/**" location="/resources/"></mvc:resources>
```
In the view pages, you can access static files using:
``` html
<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/images/spring-logo.png">
```
You will need to use the JSP expression "${pageContext.request.contextPath}" to access the correct root directory.

Same for CSS and JS.
``` html
 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/css/my-test.css">

<script src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/js/simple-test.js"></script>
```

***Note:***
You can deploy to Tomcat using Web Application Archive (WAR) files.
They are a compressed version of your web app (sort of like the minfied js file of any frontend app).
It's actually a .zip file but uses the .war extension.
It's the same as WebContent compressed as a zip file.
It has all the pages, images, css, js, since your code compiles into WEB-INF/classes, it also has your classes, along with supporting classes in WEB-INF/lib.
WAR files are part of the JEE specification, so all JEE servers support this format.

Steps to to if you want:
1. In Eclipse, stop Tomcat

2. Right-click your project and select Export > WAR File

3. In the Destination field, enter: <any-directory>/mycoolapp.war

4. Outside of Eclipse, start Tomcat
- If you are using MS Windows, then you should find it on the Start menu

5. Make sure Tomcat is up and running by visiting: http://localhost:8080

6. Deploy your new WAR file by copying it to <tomcat-install-directory>\webapps

Give it about 10-15 seconds to make the deployment. You'll know the deployment is over because you'll see a new folder created in webapps ... with your WAR file name.

7. Visit your new app. If your war file was: mycoolapp.war then you can access it with:  http://localhost:8080/mycoolapp

# Spring MVC Request Params and Mappings
This is a different technique for reading form data.
Spring has an annotation @RequestParam.
This allows us to read form data AND automatically bind it to a parameter in our methods.
Behind the scenes, Spring:
- Reads the requested data.
- Bind it to the variable we want.

How do we do this in code?
In HelloWorldController in the new method we added, copy it and paste it, giving it a new name and new Request Mapping.
Now, in the new function, we'll change it a bit:
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/processFormVersionThree")
public String processFormVersionThree(
		@RequestParam("studentName") String theName
		, Model model) {
		
	theName = theName.toUpperCase();
		
	String message = "Yo sup dude! " + theName;
		
	model.addAttribute("message", message);
		
	return "confirm";
}
```
Notice many things:
- We removed the HttpServletRequest parameter, and instead used the @RequestParam and after it a String theName.
	- Spring got the data and bound it to theName behind the scenes.
- So we didn't need the explicit line that gets the data and puts it into theName, so we removed it.
- The rest is the same.

Go to form.jsp, change the action to "processFormVersionThree".
Run it, it'll be working like Bill Gates will interview it.(what?) :sunglasses:

## Adding Controller Request Mapping
We can define request mappings at the controller level.
It acts like the parent mapping for the controller.
Any methods with mapping are mapped RELATIVE to the controller's path, so a mapping on the controller acts as a root directory from which the request mapping are Looked for.
Now method mappings are relative to the PARENT MAPPING on the controller.

Which is a great technique to classify mappings and avoid naming conflicts between mappings.

Create a new controller class, name it whatever.
Inside it, add a method with a request mapping that is THE SAME AS another mapping in HelloWorldController e.g. "processFormVersionThree".
Just copy a previous mapping and paste it.

Now run it. <br />
The console window will raise many exceptions, such as:
- ServletException.
- IllegalStateException: Ambiguous Mapping, which says that the mapping is already being used (The error we're looking for).

If you look at the web page, you'll see the 500 error.

***Note:*** That error will be common for you Spring developers, poor souls xD

How to solve this?
In the HelloWorldController, add a mapping ABOVE the controller itself:
``` Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/hello")
public class HelloWorldController {
	...
}
```

That means, we need to go to our main-menu.jsp file and change *le* href attribute of *le* anchor tag to point to *le* hello/showForm, not *le* showForm directly.

# Spring MVC Form Tags and Data Binding
We already know HTML form tags.
But Spring MVC has some form tags that lift a lot of the work off our backs.
Check them out here:
www.luv2code.com/spring-mvc-form-tags

How to use them?
- In th View page, we just write HTML, and inside it we write Spring MVC tags.
- Reference them using taglib reference.

We'll do this:
- We'll have two forms: first name and last name.
- User submits them.
- Controller sends user to confirmation page.

To show the form, we MUST add the model attribute, Which is a bean that holds form data, that is used for data binding.

We'll write a method in the controller that:
- Receives parameter "Model theModel".
- Adds a new Student() object to the model. (We'll see the Student class later).
- The Spring MVC input forms have an attribute "path", that is used to bind this form field to a property on the bean.
	Example: 
	- if path="firstName", 
	- when the form is loaded, 
	- Spring will call a method like getFirstName(),
	- and gets the data if there is data.
	- When the form is submitted, the model will be set by calling setFirstName().

- So, in our method, we can use getFirstName and setFirstName.
- Also, actual data binding will happen when we use Spring MVC forms without us explicitly doing it, which is the biggest feature of it.

So what is the development process steps?
Steps:
1. Create Student class.
2. Create Student Controller class.
3. Create an HTML form.
4. Create the form processing code.
5. Create the confirmation page.

**Step 1: Create Student class**<br/>
- Create a new class, Student. 
- Put two private fields in it: firstName, lastName.
- Generate setters and getters for both fields. 
``` Java
public class Student {
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	
	public Student() {
		
	}

	public String getFirstName() {
		return firstName;
	}

	public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
	}

	public String getLastName() {
		return lastName;
	}

	public void setLastName(String lastName) {
		this.lastName = lastName;
	}
}
```

**Step 2: Create Student Controller class**<br/>
- Create a new class, StudentController.
- Annotate it with @Controller and @RequestMapping("/student").
- Add a method to show the form.
- Inside that method, create a new Student() object.
- Add the new Student to the Model.
``` Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/student")
public class StudentController {
	
	@RequestMapping("/showForm")
	public String showForm(Model theModel) {
		Student theStudent = new Student();
		theModel.addAttribute("student", theStudent);
		return "student-form";
	}
}
```

**Step 3: Create an HTML form**<br/>
- Create a new file in WEB-INF/view called "student-form.jsp".
- The form:form is the Spring MVC form tag.
- Make sure that the taglib IS EXACTLY like this.
- When the form is loaded, Spring calls getFirstName() and getLastName().
- When the form is submitted, Spring calls setFirstName() and setLastName().
``` html
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Moamen's student form</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- Using the Spring MVC form tag -->
		<form:form action="processForm" modelAttribute="student">
		<!-- 
			the modelAttribute MUST match the code we used in our controller,
			so if we added a new Student() with the key "student" in the model,
			this attribute must have THE EXACT KEY.
		 -->
		 
		 First name: <form:input path="firstName"></form:input>
		<br />
		
		 Last name: <form:input path="lastName"></form:input>
		<br />
		<input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
		</form:form>
	</body>
</html>
```
**Step 4: Create the form processing code**<br/>
- Go to StudentController.
- Add a new method and map it to /processForm.
``` Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/student")
public class StudentController {
	
	@RequestMapping("/showForm")
	public String showForm(Model theModel) {
		Student theStudent = new Student();
		theModel.addAttribute("student", theStudent);
		return "student-form";
	}

	// Here is the new method
	@RequestMapping("/processForm")
	public String processForm(@ModelAttribute("student") Student theStudent) {

		// you can sysout things here to test it, for example:
		System.out.println(theStudent.getFirstName());
		return "student-confirm";
	}
}
```

**Step 5: Create the confirmation page**<br/>
- Create a new file in WEB-INF/view called "student-confirm.jsp".
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Moamen's student confirmation</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		The student ${student.firstName} ${student.lastName} is confirmed.
		<!-- 
			student.firstName will make Spring call getFirstName() 
			same for student.lastName
		--> 		
	</body>
</html>
```

- Also, change the main-menu.jsp file.
- We'll copy *le* achor tag and paste *le* anchor tag but change *le* href attribute to *le* "student/showForm", *s'il vous plait*.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Moamen is average</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Moamen is indeed average, but that makes him awesome</p>
<div><a href="hello/showForm">Click to go to the hello form</a></div>
<div><a href="student/showForm">Click to go to the student form</a></div>

</body>
</html>
```

- Now run *le* app and check *le* result.
- Nice work :smile: <br/>

## Spring MVC Dropdown Lists
Steps:
1. Update HTML form.
2. Update Student class.
3. Update confirmation page.
**Step 1: Update HTML form**<br/>
- Go to student-form.jsp.
- Add a Spring MVC dropdown list tag, and add some options to it:
- Give the form path="country" attribute:
``` html
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Moamen's student form</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<form:form action="processForm" modelAttribute="student">
		 
		 First name: <form:input path="firstName"></form:input>
		<br />
		
		 Last name: <form:input path="lastName"></form:input>
		<br />
		
		Country: <form:select path="country">
			<form:option value="USA" label="USA"/>
			<form:option value="Brazil" label="Brazil"/>
			<form:option value="France" label="France"/>
			<form:option value="China" label="China"/>
			<form:option value="Egypt" label="Egypt"/>
			<form:option value="Antartica" label="Antartica"/>
			<form:option value="Australia" label="Australia"/>
		</form:select> 
		
		<input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
		
		</form:form>
	</body>
</html>
```
**Step 2: Update Student class**<br/>
- Go to Student class.
- Add a new field "country".
- Generate getters and setters for it.
``` Java
public class Student {
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private String country;
	
	public String getCountry() {
		return country;
	}

	...
}
```
**Step 3: Update confirmation page** <br/>
- Go to student-confirm.jsp.
- Add the ${student.country} to it.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Moamen's student confirmation</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		The student ${student.firstName} ${student.lastName} is confirmed.
		<br />
		Country: ${student.country }
	</body>
</html>
```

Now run it, and see the result.

Real nice :smile: <br/>

**Wait, what if we want to read the list of countries from a JAVA class, not hardcode it?** <br/>

Steps:
1. Define country options in a class.
- Go to Student.
- Add a LinkedHashMap field whose key and value are Strings.
- In the no-arg constructor, init and populate the LinkedHashMap.
- Generate getters for the LinkedHashMap.
``` Java
public class Student {
	...
	private LinkedHashMap<String, String> countryOptions;
	
	public LinkedHashMap<String, String> getCountryOptions() {
		return countryOptions;
	}

	...

	public Student() {
		countryOptions = new LinkedHashMap<>();
		countryOptions.put("USA", "USA");
		countryOptions.put("Brazil", "Brazil");
		countryOptions.put("France", "France");
		countryOptions.put("China", "China");
		countryOptions.put("Egypt", "Egypt");
		countryOptions.put("Antartica", "Antartica");
		countryOptions.put("Australia", "Australia");
		// To see that it really changes, we'll add one more
		countryOptions.put("Spaaaace", "Spaaaace");
	}

	...
}
```
2. Step 2: Update the form to use these values, not the hardcoded ones.
- Go to student-form.jsp.
- Instead of <form:option>, use <form:option***s*** items="${student.countryOptions}">.
``` html
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Moamen's student form</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		...
		Country: <form:select path="country">
			<form:options items="${student.countryOptions}" />
		</form:select> 
		
		<input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
		
		</form:form>
	</body>
</html>
```

Now run it. <br/>
Does it work? <br/>
Does it really work? <br/>
I said it would work, didn't I? <br/>

***Get on my level, son!***

(would be a shame if it didn't run xD )

**We can also read the countries from a Properties File** <br/>
1. Create a properties file in WEB-INF directly, called "countries.properties".
***Note:*** IT MUST BE IN THE WEB-INF DIRECTLY.

2. Add key=value:
``` txt
Brazil=Brazil
USA=USA
```

3. Go to spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml, remove the header and add this:
``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" 
        xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context" 
        xmlns:mvc="http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc" 
        xmlns:util="http://www.springframework.org/schema/util" 
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
        xsi:schemaLocation="
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/context     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc         
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc/spring-mvc.xsd 
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/util     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util.xsd">
```

4. Load the properties file in the Spring config file.
- Go to spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml.
- Add the following lines:
``` xml
<util:properties id="countryOptions" location="classpath:../countries.properties" />
```

5. Inject the properties values into your Spring Controller: StudentController.java
``` Java
@Value("#{countryOptions}") 
private Map<String, String> countryOptions;
```

5. Add the country options to the Spring MVC model. Attribute name: theCountryOptions
``` Java
@RequestMapping("/showForm") 
public String showForm(Model theModel) { 
 
    // create a student object Student 
    Student theStudent = new Student();
 
    // add student object to the model 
    theModel.addAttribute("student", theStudent); 
 
    // add the country options to the model 
    theModel.addAttribute("theCountryOptions", countryOptions); 
 
    return "student-form"; 
}
```

6. Update the JSP page, student-form.jsp, to use the new model attribute for the drop-down list: theCountryOptions
``` html
<form:select path="country"> 
 <form:options items="${theCountryOptions}" />
</form:select>
```
7. Remove all references to country option from your Student.java. 

Now run it :smile: <br />
