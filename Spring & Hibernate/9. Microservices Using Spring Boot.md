**What is a web service anyway?** <br/>
A formal definition of a web service is a "service" that is communicated over the web.

**What's a simpler way to say it?**<br/>
When you open your PC, and you open Youtube, what appears to you is the homepage of Youtube with recommended videos, your subscriptions' videos, etc.

What happened between you and the PC is that you opened youtube.
What happened between your PC and the Youtube server may be much more.

For example, the Youtube server may request your username and password, so your PC sends them over.

If you search youtube for something, that string you wrote in the search bar is send by your PC to the server, where the server searches and does a lot of stuff, before getting a list of videos that match your search string, and sends them back, where they are rendered on your PC to look like the list we know today.

The server requested your user & pass.
Your PC requested a list of things that match a string.
The server sent a list of things that match that string.

So, we can say that Youtube offers a search service for users.
The communication between your PC and Youtube is in the form of requests, responses, etc.

These are "Services" between your PC and the server, over the internet.

That is a *Web service*.

A *Web service* is a piece of software that runs on a computer, and offers to run some software logic, or *"service"* to other computers, communicating with each other over some network.

Web services are:
- designed to be communicated between machines, PCs, computers, **applications running on computers**, not human beings (Yes, you type the search string and press enter, but your PC does all the work from that point on).
- are communicated over a Network, be it the internet or any other network.
- not platform dependent, ANY machine in the world should be able to send Youtube servers search requests.

**How does PCs or applications send and receive data to and from each other?** <br/>
Your PC and the Youtube server are connected, but to get search results:
- Your PC needs to tell the server "I want videos that match this string". This is called a *Request*.
- The server does its logic.
- The server tells your PC "I got the videos you requested, here it is", this message is sent to your PC along with the list of videos. This is called a *Response*.

This means, that for a web service to be platform independent (one of its properties we said earlier), the format of Requests and Responses should not depend on the sending pc or receiving server's specifications.

So, the formats of Requests and Responses should be standardized.

The two standard formats for Requests and Responses are:
1. XML: eXtensible Marup Language, this can be generated from any application on any PC, whether the application is a Java app, a PHP app, etc.

Also this can be sent by any PC, be it the Titan Supercomputer or a nokia 6600.

2. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, same thing, can be sent by any application on any PC.

**So how does your PC or the server know the format?** <br/>
When your PC and the server are connected, they sign a contract between each other, this contract specifies:
- the **format** that is used by Requests and Responses,
- the **structure of the request** that the PC should send to the server,
- the **structure of the response** that should be expected by your PC, and
- the **endpoint** of the service, *what URL should I use to request the service?*.

This contract is called a *Service Definition*.

The format used by Requests and Responses is called the *Message Exchange Format*.

Your PC is a *service consumer*, it Consumes the service offered by the server.

The Youtube server is the *service provider*, it hosts the service and listens for requests by any connected PC.

**How are web services called through their endpoints?**
Endpoint: the URL of the service that your PC uses to send a request to the server.

Your PC is using the internet to do that, it's using *HTTP requests* to call that service.

There is another way for web services, a **Queue**.
- Service consumer places a message on the queue.
- Service provider listens to the queue, 
- as soon as it gets the message from the queue, it takes the request, do the logic, creates the response, then puts it in the queue,
- the service consumer listens to the queue, until it gets the response.

So, web services are communicated through:
- HTTP, over the internet.
- MQ, over queues in the network.

This is called *transport*.

**Recap** <br/>
- Your PC connects to the server.
- Your PC and the server sign a contract, a *service definition*, that specifies how the web service is offered to your PC.
- You search for a string and press enter.
- Your PC reads the *service definition* to know what *message exchange format* the web service expects.
- Then, your PC takes your string, along with other data, and organizes it in the format specified by the *service definition*.
- Your PC then reads the *service definition* to know what is the *endpoint* of the service, how can we reach that service.
- Your PC then uses that *endpoint* to call the service, since this is the internet, the service is called in a specific way, a *transport*, called HTTP.

### Types of Web Services
Web services are divided into two types:
- SOAP.
- REST.

**Wait what?**
Basically, XML is a markup language, it's a format, but it doesn't specify a specific **structure** of a message.

Therefore, there is a standard structure written in XML for web services, this is called a *Simple Object Access Protocol*, or *SOAP*.

*SOAP* is a specific XML structure that is used by web services, it consists of three main parts:
- **Header:** this doesn't contain your actual message, it contains data needed by the two machines to communicate with each other, like authentication, authorization, etc.
- **Body:** this is where you put your actual message, the search string is put here.
- **Envelope:** an element that is wrapper for the whole message, it contains the Header and the Body.

Messages that are structured in a SOAP structure, or *SOAP messages*, can be sent through any type of *transport* i.e. HTTP or MQ (Queues).

**Service Definition in SOAP** <br/>
Remember the contract signed by your PC and the youtube server? the *service definition*.

If your PC and the server communicate using *SOAP messages*, the *service definition* is written in an XML-based language, called *Web Service Definition Language* or *Web Service Description Language*, or just **WSDL**.

**There is another type of web services, specific to HTTP transport** <br/>

HTTP messages actually consist of several parts:
1. HTTP body: the message send by your PC or the server.
2. HTTP Method: this indicates what you want to do with the data:
    - GET: you want the server to fetch you some data.
    - POST: you want to add some new data in the server.
    - PUT: you want to update some existing data in the server.
    - DELETE: you want to remove some existing data from the server.
3. HTTP Status Code: this indicates the status of the service call, for example:
    - 200: this means that the call was successful.
    - 404: this means that what you requested was not found (I know you've seen this error before xD)

Web services should be designed to use all three parts of HTTP in order to communicate effectively, therefore, how web services are designed also should be standardized.

To fill all HTTP parts, a web service must adhere to some constraints, these constraints are grouped together in a standard called *REpresentational State Transfer* or *REST*.

Web services that are designed according to *REST* concepts are called *RESTful* web services.

**What are the *REST* constraints that web services should adhere to?** <br/>
- When we say a "Resource", we mean anything that you want to expose to the world using your app, for example the videos on youtube, the list of videos itself, etc.
- Each one of these videos **must be identified** by something that is unique, a *Unique Resource Identifier*, a *URI*.
- Since web services should be compatible with HTTTP, they **must support** all HTTP methods i.e. they should support:
    + Creation of data (POST).
    + Fetching of data (GET).
    + Updating of data (PUT).
    + Deletion of data (DELETE).

So, a *RESTful* web service must:
- Have a *Unique Resource Identifier*, a *URI*.
- Support all HTTP methods.

***Note:*** Unlike SOAP, *REST* doesn't care about the format of your message, be it XML, JSON, etc., it defines how this message is communicated across the network.

RESTful web services don't have a standard *service definition* language like SOAP, which has *WSDL*.
But, there are definitions for RESTful web services, like WADL and Swagger, here we'll use Swagger.

In this course, we'll use web services in Spring Boot.
