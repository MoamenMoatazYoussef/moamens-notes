# Leftovers
What are leftovers? <br/>
They are the things that I've skipped during learning this due to other commitments, and haven't returned to study them and write notes for them.

Also, leftover actions are things that I will do in the future concerning some notes e.g. update, change some things, etc.

Any leftover will be covered in the future.
Any leftover that has been covered will be removed from the list below.
