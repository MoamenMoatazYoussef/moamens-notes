# Docker

## What are these whales??
Basically, a big problem that faces SWEs is the infrastructure of the PC that we're working on, like OS, environment, setup, configurations, dependencies, resources, and even hardware like CPU and stuff.

I mean, we just want to write code xD

Docker is the solution for this problem, docker provides a way to enable us to write code that is independent of the infrastructure.

But wait, don't virtual machines do that?

Yeah, but they are VERY SLOW, because they run an entire OS on top of your OS, then run your code on the OS on your OS, yeah that's a lot of overhead.

Docker doesn't do that, docker is basically a small virtual machine with no OS and no additional configs, just basic stuff and your code.

This also means that moving code from dev through testing to production is streamlined.
